# Working with APIs

I will be developing a GitHub User Search Application using React. This project will guide you through integrating with the GitHub API, handling user authentication, and deploying your application to a web hosting platform. I will gain hands-on experience in API interactions, advanced HTTP networking, and deploying web applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I will be able to:

1. **Set Up a React Project for API Integration:**

- Create and configure a new React application for integrating with external APIs, specifically the GitHub API.
    
2. **Develop Basic and Advanced Search Features Using GitHub API:**

- Implement basic search functionality to fetch and display GitHub user data.

- Enhance the search functionality to include advanced filtering criteria, such as location and repository count.
    
3. **Improve User Interface and Experience:**

- Utilize Tailwind CSS to style my application, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design.

4. **Deploy the Application to a Web Hosting Platform:**

- Deploy my application to Vercel, making it publicly accessible and ensuring it performs well under real-world conditions.
